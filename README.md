## Assessing Source Contributions to Air Quality and Noise in Unconventional Oil Shale Plays

### Overview
This repository contains data and code for analyzing source contributions to air pollution and noise in the Permian Basin, one of the most active unconventional oil and gas production regions in the world. Specifically, it supports a year-long (May 2023 through May 2024) ambient monitoring campaign conducted in Loving, New Mexico (LNM) situated in the Delaware sub-basin of the Permian.

The monitoring program was designed to quantify the influence of different unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) activities such as flaring, venting, combustion, traffic, and produced water ponds on local air quality and noise pollution. 

### Data
The data collected at LNM includes continuous, high temporal resolution measurements of:
- Ambient air pollutants and greenhouse gases, including nitrogen oxides (NO, NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), radon, particle radioactivity, 20 speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
- Meteorology, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction.
- Noise, 1/3 octave frequency bands and weighted sound pressure levels in decibels (dB).

Supplemental data includes:
- Satellite-detected flares from the Visible Imaging Spectroradiometer (VIIRS) [Nightfire](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnf/)
